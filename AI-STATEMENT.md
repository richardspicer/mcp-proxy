## **Personal Statement on AI-Assisted Engineering**

I build using a **human-led, AI-augmented workflow**. AI assistants help accelerate drafting, code exploration, and research, but every component is validated, rebuilt, and understood by me before it becomes part of the project.

My goal is transparency and ethical practice. AI tools make it possible for solo practitioners to explore complex systems, iterate rapidly, and develop reproducible demos—but human oversight, accountability, and technical judgment remain central to everything I produce.

I view AI not as a substitute for expertise, but as a **tool that amplifies learning and experimentation**.
All work I present reflects my genuine understanding, my hands-on engineering effort, and my commitment to honest, reproducible MLSecOps practice.
